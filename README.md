Image Classification on MNIST Data Set
Performed preprocessing and developed a neural network model using TensorFlow to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
This project involves the classification of handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The primary goal is to preprocess the data and develop a neural network model using TensorFlow to accurately classify the digits.

Tech Stack Used:

TensorFlow: Framework for building and training the neural network.
Seaborn: Data visualization library for plotting.
